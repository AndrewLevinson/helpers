# helpers

## Collection of helpful code snippets and files to reuse on projects

## CSS

### Normalize

Classic. 1st piece of css on every project.

### default.css

Comes from Zell Liew to build on top of normalize. It includes box-sizing and fixing other things that normalize doesn't. I find it to generally be applicable on every project but I augment on a project-by-project basis.

### typography.css

This is my standard typography css sheet. It was based on the typography section of the Skeleton.css starter package but striped down to essentials. Comes before my main.css file(s) which would contain any type overrides.

Disclaimer: many (but not all) of these snippets and files were collected from other open source projects and other developers who have shared their code through blog posts and are much more talented than myself. I attribute credit in comments in the code at the top for entire files and inline for certain blocks.

Anyone who finds these helpful can use these on their projects. You do not need to credit me unless noted in the code.
